# Contribution Process

If you want to contribute to this project, there are many valuable ways in doing so

1. Join the weekly community calls as indicated in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
1. Use / test TerraTorch and create an [Issue](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/issues) if something is not working properly or if you have an idea for a feature request.
1. Pick an [Issue](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/issues) and start contributing

Contributions are welcome as pull requests on a [fork](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/fork) of this project. Ideally, pull requests are backed by an [Issue](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/issues). You can also tag the [code owners](https://github.com/IBM/terratorch/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) in the issue before you start, so we can talk about the details (in case you can't join one of the community calls).
